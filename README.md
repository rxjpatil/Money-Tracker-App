# Money Tracker App

Track your expenses and income with this simple Money Tracker app. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB to provide a basic yet functional money tracking experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/money-tracker-app.git
   cd money-tracker-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server:

   Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine. You can start it with the following command:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

4. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Money Tracker app.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: HTML file containing the money tracker form.
- **`styles.css`**: CSS file for styling the money tracker form.
- **`server.js`**: Node.js file that sets up an Express server and handles adding new transactions. It connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.

## Dependencies

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): Node.js body parsing middleware.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Add transactions by providing a description, amount, and selecting the transaction type (income or expense).
3. Transactions will be stored in the MongoDB database.

## Additional Notes

- This is a basic example intended for learning purposes. In a production environment, you should implement additional features such as user authentication, data validation, and security measures.
- Ensure MongoDB is properly configured and running on your machine.
